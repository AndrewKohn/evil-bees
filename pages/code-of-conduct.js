					INTRODUCTION
				</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Evill Bees,
					including but not limited to: all public and private mailing lists,
					issue trackers, wikis, blogs, Twitter; as well as any other
					communication channel used by our communities. A code of conduct which
					is specific to in-person events (ie., conferences) is codified in the
					published ASF anti-harassment policy. We expect this code of conduct
					to be honored by all who participate in the Evil Bees community
					formally or informally, or claim any affiliation with the community,
					in any community-related activities and especially when representing
					the Evil Bees, in any role. This code is{" "}
					<strong>not exhaustive or complete</strong>. It serves to distill our
					common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals.
					We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter, so
					that it can enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we
					participate.

					SPECIFIC GUIDELINES
				</h2>
				<br />
				<p className="z-10 max-w-4xl font-display text-l font-medium tracking-tight text-left text-slate-900 sm:text-l">
					We strive to:
				</p>
				<br />
				<ol className="list-disc">
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Be open.</strong> We invite anyone to participate in our
							community. We preferably use public methods of communication for
							project-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive.
							This applies to messages regarding help or project-related
							support, too. Not only is a public support request much more
							likely to result in an answer to a question, it also makes sure
							that any inadvertent mistakes made by people answering will be
							more easily detected and corrected.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient.</strong>{" "}
							We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and
							do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience
							some frustration from time to time, but we can not allow
							frustration to turn into any sort of personal attack. After all, a
							community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a
							productive one. It&apos;s imperitive for all to remain respectful when
							dealing with other community members as well as those outside of
							our community.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Be collaborative.</strong> Our work will be used by other
							people, and in turn we will depend on the work of others. When we
							make something for the benefit of the project, we must be willing
							to explain to others how it works, so that they can build on the
							work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect
							users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously
							when making decisions.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Be inquisitive.</strong> Nobody knows everything! Asking
							questions early on avoids many problems later. Thus, questions are
							encouraged, although they ought to be directed to the appropriate
							forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful,
							within the context of our shared goal of improving the Evil Bees
							codebase.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Be careful in with words you choose to use.</strong>{" "}
							Whether you are are participating as a professional or a
							volunteer, we value professionalism in all interactions, and take
							responsibility for our own words. Be kind to others. Never insult
							or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
							behavior are not acceptable nor will they be tolerated. This
							includes, but is not limited to:
						</p>
						<ul className="list-inside list-disc">
							<li>
								Violent threats or language directed against another person.
							</li>
							<li>
								Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
							</li>
							<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
							<li>
								Posting (or threatening to post) other people&#39;s personally
								identifying information (&quot;aka doxing&quot;).
							</li>
							<li>
								Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or
								non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history.
							</li>
							<li>
								Personal insults, especially those with racist or sexist
								undertones.
							</li>
							<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
							<li>Excessive or unnecessary use of profanities.</li>
							<li>
								Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you
								to stop, then stop.
							</li>
							<li>
								Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the aforementioned
								behavior or language.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Be concise.</strong> Keep in mind that what you write once
							will be read by hundreds of people. Writing a short email means
							people can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible.
							Short emails should also strive to be empathetic, welcoming,
							friendly and patient. When a long explanation is necessary,
							consider adding a summary. Try to bring new ideas to a
							conversation so that each mail adds something unique to the
							thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the thread still contains
							the other messages with arguments that have already been made. Try
							to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already
							fairly large.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Step down considerately.</strong> Members of every project
							come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project
							they should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps
							to ensure that others can pick up where they left off. In doing
							so, they should remain respectful of those who continue to
							participate in the project and should not misrepresent the
							project&#39;s goals or achievements. Likewise, community members
							should respect any individual&#39;s choice to leave the project.
						</p>

					DIVERSITY STATEMENT
				</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					Evil Bees welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are
					committed to being a community that consists of lighthearted jokes and
					positive interactions. Although we may not be able to satisfy
					everyone, we will always work to treat everyone as best we can. No
					matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you - we
					welcome you. Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we
					explicitly honour diversity in: age, culture, ethnicity, genotype,
					gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype,
					phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual
					orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical
					ability.Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, Evil Bees
					development is conducted in English. Standards for behaviour in the
					Evil Bees community are detailed in the Code of Conduct above. We
					expect participants in our community to meet these standards in all
					their interactions and to encourage others to do so as well.

					REPORTING GUIDELINES
				</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					While this code of conduct should be adhered to by participants, we
					recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of
					some of the guidelines in this code of conduct. When that happens, you
					may message them in order to point out this code of conduct. Such
					messages may be in public or in private, whatever feels most
					appropriate. However, regardless of whether the message is posted
					publicly or not, it should still adhere to the relevant parts of this
					code of conduct; in particular, it should not be abusive or
					disrespectful.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, assume good faith. It is more likely that participants are
					unaware of their bad behaviour and are not intentionally trying to
					degrade the quality of the discussion. Should there be difficulties in
					dealing with the situation, you may report your compliance issues in
					confidence to either:

					Discord Community Guidelines
				</h1>
				<br />
				<p>
					If you decide to join the{" "}
					<a href="https://discord.gg/rvxGNrFhNz">Community Discord</a>, please
					adhere to the following rules:
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<strong>1. Treat everyone in the community with respect.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We strive to make this community a welcoming place for people - from
					all industries, use cases, geographies, backgrounds and walks of life.
					Harassment of any kind is not acceptable and won&apos;t be tolerated.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<strong>2. Use the right channel</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Channels are an effective way for organizing and focusing discussions
					while also empowering members to opt-in to the types of content
					they&apos;re interested in. When questions are posted or discussions are
					started in the wrong channel, it dilutes the trust of the members in
					the channel and, more practically, makes it harder for your questions
					to be answered.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<strong>3. Ask thoughtful questions</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							We&apos;re all here to help each other out. The best way to get help is
							by investing effort into your questions. First check and see if
							your question is answered in Github Wiki, Discord Channels or in
							the project&apos;s README. Then, use Discord search to see if your
							question has already been asked and answered in the past. If you
							still feel the need to ask a question, make sure you include:
						</p>
					</li>
					<ul className="list-inside list-disc">
						<li>The steps you&apos;ve already taken</li>
						<li>
							Relevant details presented cleanly (text stacktraces, formatted
							markdown, or screenshots. Please don&apos;t paste large blocks of code
							unformatted or post photos of your screen from your phone).
						</li>
						<li>
							The specific question you have or the specific type of help
							you&#39;re seeking.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p>
					<strong>4. Avoid double posting</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					This Discord community is not a customer support channel and all
					members are here voluntarily. If you aren’t getting a response to a
					question you have, make sure you look at rules 1, 2, and 3. It’s also
					worth remembering that there may not be someone in the community who
					has the context to help you out.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<strong>5. Communicate openly</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Unless you have explicit permission from the person, please avoid
					sending direct messages to individuals. Communicating in public
					channels ensures that we&apos;re all respecting each other&apos;s attentions and
					we can scalably moderate our communication to mitigate harassment or
					discrimination. Do not use direct messages to pitch products and
					services. If you are receiving unwelcome direct messages, please
					notify an admin.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<strong>
						6. Practice good Discord hygiene by using threads for discussions
						and emojis for light reactions
					</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The medium is the message. Discord can foster a welcoming,
						collaborative, and organized community when used effectively. We
						want to respect people&apos;s attentions (thread notifications &gt;
						channel notifications &gt; DM notifications) and we want to improve
						information density (a member should be able to browse and explore
						many convo threads, not just see one thread discussed in a top level
						channel).
					</li>
				</ul>
