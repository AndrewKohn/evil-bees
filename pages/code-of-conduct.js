				INTRODUCTION
			</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Evill Bees,
				all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs,
				Twitter, and any other communication channel used by our communities. A
				code of conduct which is specific to in-person events (ie., conferences)
				is codified in the published ASF anti-harassment policy. We expect this
				code of conduct to be honored by everyone who participates in the Evil
				Bees community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with
				the community, in any community-related activities and especially when
				representing the ASF, in any role. This code is{" "}
				<strong>not exhaustive or complete</strong>. It serves to distill our
				common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals.
				We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter, so that
				it can enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we
				participate.

				SPECIFIC GUIDELINES
			</h2>
			<br />
			<p className="z-10 max-w-4xl font-display text-l font-medium tracking-tight text-left text-slate-900 sm:text-l">
				We strive to:
			</p>
			<br />
			<ol className="list-disc">
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Be open.</strong> We invite anyone to participate in our
						community. We preferably use public methods of communication for
						project-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive.
						This applies to messages for help or project-related support, too;
						not only is a public support request much more likely to result in
						an answer to a question, it also makes sure that any inadvertent
						mistakes made by people answering will be more easily detected and
						corrected.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient.</strong> We
						work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and do
						our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience some
						frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to
						turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel
						uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We should be
						respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with
						people outside our community.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Be collaborative.</strong> Our work will be used by other
						people, and in turn we will depend on the work of others. When we
						make something for the benefit of the project, we are willing to
						explain to others how it works, so that they can build on the work
						to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect users and
						colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making
						decisions.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Be inquisitive.</strong> Nobody knows everything! Asking
						questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are
						encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum.
						Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful, within the
						context of our shared goal of improving Evil Bees projects code.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Be careful in the words that we choose.</strong> Whether we
						are participating as professionals or volunteers, we value
						professionalism in all interactions, and take responsibility for our
						own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other
						participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not
						acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
					</p>
					<ul className="list-inside list-disc">
						<li>
							Violent threats or language directed against another person.
						</li>
						<li>
							Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
						</li>
						<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
						<li>
							Posting (or threatening to post) other people&#39;s personally
							identifying information (&quot;doxing&quot;).
						</li>
						<li>
							Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or
							non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history.
						</li>
						<li>
							Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
						</li>
						<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
						<li>Excessive or unnecessary profanity.</li>
						<li>
							Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to
							stop, then stop.
						</li>
						<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Be concise.</strong> Keep in mind that what you write once
						will be read by hundreds of persons. Writing a short email means
						people can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible.
						Short emails should always strive to be empathetic, welcoming,
						friendly and patient. When a long explanation is necessary, consider
						adding a summary. Try to bring new ideas to a conversation so that
						each mail adds something unique to the thread, keeping in mind that
						the rest of the thread still contains the other messages with
						arguments that have already been made. Try to stay on topic,
						especially in discussions that are already fairly large.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Step down considerately.</strong> Members of every project
						come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project
						they should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps
						to ensure that others can pick up where they left off. In doing so,
						they should remain respectful of those who continue to participate
						in the project and should not misrepresent the project&#39;s goals
						or achievements. Likewise, community members should respect any
						individual&#39;s choice to leave the project.
					</p>

				DIVERSITY STATEMENT
			</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				Evil Bees welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are
				committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining.
				Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we will always work to
				treat everyone well. No matter how you identify yourself or how others
				perceive you: we welcome you. Though no list can hope to be
				comprehensive, we explicitly honour diversity in: age, culture,
				ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national
				origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race,
				religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and
				technical ability.Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, Evil
				Bees development is conducted in English. Standards for behaviour in the
				Evil Bees community are detailed in the Code of Conduct above. We expect
				participants in our community to meet these standards in all their
				interactions and to help others to do so as well.

				REPORTING GUIDELINES
			</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				While this code of conduct should be adhered to by participants, we
				recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of
				some of the guidelines in this code of conduct. When that happens, you
				may reply to them and point out this code of conduct. Such messages may
				be in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate. However,
				regardless of whether the message is public or not, it should still
				adhere to the relevant parts of this code of conduct; in particular, it
				should not be abusive or disrespectful.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you believe someone is violating this code of conduct, you may reply
				to them and point out this code of conduct. Such messages may be in
				public or in private, whatever is most appropriate. Assume good faith;
				it is more likely that participants are unaware of their bad behaviour
				than that they intentionally try to degrade the quality of the
				discussion. Should there be difficulties in dealing with the situation,
				you may report your compliance issues in confidence to either:

			<br />
			<p>
				This Code defines <strong>empathy</strong> as &quot;a vicarious
				participation in the emotions, ideas, or opinions of others; the ability
				to imagine oneself in the condition or predicament of another.&quot;{" "}
				<strong>Empathetic</strong> is the adjectival form of empathy.

				Discord Community Guidelines
			</h1>
			<br />
			<p>
				If you decide to join the{" "}
				<a href="https://discord.gg/rvxGNrFhNz">Community Discord</a>, please
				adhere to the following rules:
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<strong>1. Treat everyone in the community with respect.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				We strive to make this community a warm place for people from all
				industries, use cases, geographies, and backgrounds. Harassment of any
				kind is not acceptable and won’t be tolerated.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<strong>2. Use the right channel.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Channels are an effective way to organize and focus discussions while
				also empowering members to opt-in to the types of content they’re
				interested in. When questions are posted or discussions are started in
				the wrong channel, it dilutes the trust of the members in the channel
				and, more practically, makes it harder for your questions to be
				answered.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<strong>3. Ask thoughtful questions.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						We’re all here to help each other out. The best way to get help is
						by investing effort into your questions. First check and see if your
						question is answered in Github Wiki, Discord Channels or in READMEs.
						Then, use Discord search to see if your question has already been
						asked and answered in the past. If you still feel the need to ask a
						question, make sure you include:
					</p>
				</li>
				<ul className="list-inside list-disc">
					<li>The steps you’ve already taken</li>
					<li>
						Relevant details presented cleanly (text stacktraces, formatted
						markdown, or screenshots. Please don’t paste large blocks of code
						unformatted or post photos of your screen from your phone)
					</li>
					<li>
						The specific question you have or the specific type of help
						you&#39;re seeking
					</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<p>
				<strong>4. Avoid double posting</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				This Discord community is not a customer support channel and all members
				are here voluntarily. If you aren’t getting a response to a question you
				have, make sure you look at rules 1, 2, and 3. It’s also worth
				remembering that there may not be someone in the community who has the
				context to help you out.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<strong>5. Communicate openly</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Unless you have explicit permission from the person, please avoid
				sending direct messages to individuals. Communicating in public channels
				ensures that we’re all respecting each other’s attentions and we can
				scalably moderate our communication to mitigate harassment or
				discrimination. Do not use direct messages to pitch products and
				services. If you are receiving unwelcome direct messages, please notify
				an admin.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<strong>
					6. Practice good Discord hygiene by using threads for discussions and
					emojis for light reactions.
				</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The medium is the message. Discord can foster a warm, collaborative,
					and organized community when used effectively. We want to respect
					people’s attentions (thread notifications &gt; channel notifications
					&gt; DM notifications) and we want to improve information density (a
					member should be able to browse and explore many convo threads, not
					just see one thread discussed in a top level channel).
				</li>
			</ul>
