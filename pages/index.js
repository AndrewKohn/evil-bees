							Why Open Source?
						</h2>
						<p className="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">
							When we started working as developers, the world felt like a
							lonely, cruel place at times. The lack of communication and
							collaboration was damaging the flow of great ideas, and hindering
							their growth. We quickly took note of the fact that open-source
							projects, in addition to being more time-efficient and
							cost-affective are an amazing opportunity to grow for all. No
							matter what your skill level is, or which languages your
							well-versed in, there is always space for you to contribute and
							make the project better — while honing your skills and growing as
							a developer. The end result: The world receives an amazing
							product, one that helps solve actual issues, and you get
							invaluable experience, as well as a supportive collaborative
							community.

						What We Stand For ?
					</h2>
					<p className="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-white">
						We are not a web development organization, nor a marketing
						organization. We are a group of like-minded individuals who are
						unified by a single idea — **create something great, learn & improve
						ourselves along the way.** All of the projects and ideas we work on
						are created using the **latest technologies,** and we look into
						every aspect of the development before committing to a tech stack.
						We think that communication and planning is key, and don’t go into
						projects without thinking every aspect through. However, should
						things go awry, there will be a contingency plan set in place, as
						well as supportive community for you to lean on, and bounce ideas
						off of.
