						Why Open Source?
					</h2>

						When we started working as developers, the world felt like a lonely,
						cruel place at times. The lack of communication and collaboration
						was damaging the flow of great ideas, and hindering their growth. We
						quickly took note of the fact that open-source projects, in addition
						to being more time-efficient and cost-affective are an amazing
						opportunity to grow for all. No matter what your skill level is, or
						which languages your well-versed in, there is always space for you
						to contribute and make the project better â€” while honing your skills
						and growing as a developer. The end result: The world receives an
						amazing product, one that helps solve actual issues, and you get
						invaluable experience, as well as a supportive collaborative
						community.
