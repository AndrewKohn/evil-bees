            Why Open Source?

            When we started working as developers, the world felt like a lonely,
            cruel place at times. The lack of communication and collaboration
            was damaging the flow of great ideas, and hindering their growth. We
            quickly took note of the fact that open-source projects, in addition
            to being more time-efficient and cost-affective are an amazing
            opportunity to grow for all. No matter what your skill level is, or
            which languages your well-versed in, there is always space for you
            to contribute and make the project better â€” while honing your skills
            and growing as a developer. The end result: The world receives an
            amazing product, one that helps solve actual issues, and you get
            invaluable experience, as well as a supportive collaborative
            community.
