					We are not a web development organization, nor a marketing
					organization. We are a group of like-minded individuals who are
					unified by a single idea â€”{" "}
					<strong>
						create something great, learn & improve ourselves along the way.
					</strong>{" "}
					All of the projects and ideas we work on are created using the{" "}
					<strong>latest technologies,</strong> and we look into every aspect of
					the development before committing to a tech stack. We think that
					communication and planning is key, and don&apos;t go into projects
					without thinking every aspect through. However, should things go awry,
					there will be a contingency plan set in place, as well as supportive
					community for you to lean on, and bounce ideas off of.
