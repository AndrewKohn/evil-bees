          We are not a web development organization, nor a marketing
          organization. We are a group of like-minded individuals who are
          unified by a single idea — <strong>create something great, learn & improve
          ourselves along the way.</strong> All of the projects and ideas we work on
          are created using the <strong>latest technologies,</strong> and we look into every
          aspect of the development before committing to a tech stack. We think
          that communication and planning is key, and don’t go into projects
          without thinking every aspect through. However, should things go awry,
          there will be a contingency plan set in place, as well as supportive
          community for you to lean on, and bounce ideas off of.
